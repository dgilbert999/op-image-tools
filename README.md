image build tools for open-power

imageBuild.py merges and digitally signes multiple images into an output image based on rules from a config file.

The image build tool will first try to find any input image files in the override
 directory, if one is specified by the --ovrd parameter. Then it will look in the paths provided
 by the input parameters and/or config file, or image files generated by the input parameters or config file.
 Finally it will look in 'binaries' directory that is created based on parameters in the config file,
 unless --no_downloads is specified, in which case all cloning/downloading is blocked.

Currently the binaries are extracted from https://github.com/open-power/hostboot-binaries

Examples (from imagBuild dir):
See ./imageBuild.py --help

The case where both ekb and sbe repos exist and they are already built
```
./imageBuild.py  configs/odyssey/dd1/ody_pnor_dd1_image_config --ekb <path_to_ekb_repo> --sbe <path_to_sbe_repo> --output output --name pnor.bin
```
The case where there are only pre-built images available and they are all available in the paths provided.
./imageBuild.py <path to config file> --ekb_image <path_to_ekb_image_dir> --sbe <path_to_base_image_dir> --no_downloads --output output --name pnor.bin
```
The case where sbe is already built and at least the desired ekb archive(s) are in the overrides directory or the 'binaries' directory
```
./imageBuild.py configs/odyssey/dd1/ody_pnor_dd1_image_config --sbe <path_to_sbe_repo> --ovrd <path_to_overrides> --output output --name pnor.bin
```
The case where the ekb and sbe need to be built. If the provided location does not exist, they will be cloned from gerrit before being built.   In this example, the location where
the ekb and sbe repositories should be cloned to, and which commit to use, are specified in the config file
```
./imageBuild.py configs/odyssey/dd1/ody_pnor_dd1_image_config  --output output --name pnor.bin --build
```
